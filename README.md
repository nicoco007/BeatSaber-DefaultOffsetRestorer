# Default Offset Restorer
Reverts controller offsets to pre-1.29.4 values and behaviour.

This mod requires `openvr_api.dll` to be placed in your game's `Libs/Native` folder (you can create it if it doesn't exist). You can get the latest version of the library from [the OpenVR SDK repo](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr/tree/master/bin/win64).
